* use market orders and/or history to construct values

* trip planner -- items where sell orders in one region > buy orders in another -- use a minimum profit margin threshold and
    combine multiple offers together if possible
* combine above entries with a route calculator to produce a 'most profitable route'

* create report as html page -- auto-open in browser
** html page includes link to chart

* store token data in sqlite instead of pickle (avoids unpickle nametuple resolution problem)
* set up callback handler to make adding new character tokens less manual

* log file with auto-rotation

* replace ESI service call with static db lookup for type and station data

* store best path from Sweeper into waypoints computer in-game


DONE:
* Construct useful location name for non-station locations (ships, containers)  1/8/2017
* Break out ships as a separate grouping in the report  1/9/2017
* combine ship value and ship contents into an aggregate ship value  1/9/2017
* add current wallet total to report, to produce a total net worth  1/9/2017
* create a historical record -- each time AssetReport is run store the current values. 1/9/2017
* fix type_info lookup for skillbooks 1/20/2017
* generate graphs from historical record
* add escrow to historical record and graph  3/18/2017
* (Sweeper) cleanup path planner -- find a round trip route that optimizes number of jumps+stops to up items from stations and return
    to the market hub.  Try and maximize value of items picked up, minimize number of jumps, and do not exceed cargo volume
    of the ship doing the pickup.  Exclude large items like ships and station containers.
* (Sweeper2) Sweeper improvement -- improve path selection algorithm.
* Sweeper2 improvement -- have a time limit on the search -- return best path found at end of time limit
